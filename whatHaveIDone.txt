**this is not my beautiful house**

I feel kind of broken. And I know that sounds edgy, but it’s true. I mean a very specific thing when I say broken, not just sad. An internal mechanism that allows me to enjoy learning and do it in excess seems to have been stopped. And, yet another thing I think, this has happened for a very noticeable reason.

**uhhh i dont know what to put here**

This mechanism has been broken in an effort to chase intelligence and knowledge not for the sake of it, but for the image of being intelligent and knowledgable. I can trace this back to 2 distinct events (that I’ll talk about) which spurred this in me.

**least problematic aspect of my life vs most problematic aspect of how i view other peoples lives**

The first event involves a person I very much look up to complimenting this mechanism and how I utilized it. This then put into perspective what I was doing, in which I became sort of “corrupt” with the thought of somebody learning where that somebody is me, rather than the thought of me learning. It was after this that my enjoyment of learning STEM topics and linguistics starkly fell off. I was, again, infatuated with learning STEM rather than knowing STEM. And I didn’t really notice it at the time, but it reared its ugly head when I got mad at myself for not understanding something on the first go not because it was frustrating, but because it didn’t perpetuate this self-image of a natural-born STEM learner and understander (paradox! Or more like contradiction).

**<extremely indoor inside joke>im so hungry</extremely indoor inside joke>**

The second event involved a teacher I had last year, who was extremely keen on complimenting my intelligence whenever I had. To be fair, this was also most likely because I was denying his claims and also arguing to him that no one is really born “intelligent” in the sense that we see it today. Because this was a whole lot more frequent, it did a lot more damage to this mechanism than the previous event. By that point, I was well aware of what was happening, and the flattery was far less appreciated.

**fuck**

All’s to say, I’m pissed. I’m so incredibly furious at myself for doing this to me. That mechanism was one of the onl good things about me and I ruined it, and for that, I’ll never forgive myself.

**ill be working to fix it in the upcoming weeks, ill give you an update then. signing off**
