I'm just going to be straight with whoever is reading this and say that I am in high school. In fact, I am a self-proclaimed 'over-achiever.' With this being said, it would be (may be) useful to actually *prove* what this does for me, to prove what I'm (we're) doing. 

To put it bluntly, I 'over-work' myself in order to achieve better grades, I achieve better grades in order to go to a good college, I go to a good college in order to over-work myself as the best years of my life are spent on a computer pecking away at problem after problem until I inevitably die at the ripe old age of 42. Is this the answer to how to 'contribute to society?' Absolutely not. It is, however, a great way to piss off people who have already gone down this road before looking at me, who they know full well will become as burned-out-for-the-next-10-year as they do, after telling me time after time that what I'm doing could kill me.

'Life is just an endless chase,' they'll say. 'This will only bring you despair,' they'll continue. This entire post is essentially an overblown response to that statement.

**tldr: 'This will only bring you despair', 'ok and?'**

We all know that almost every single human goal and motivation is arbitrary (for example: over-achieving in high school), so why even bother pursuing at all if no form of hapiness awaits you at the end? I came upon this existential crisis in about 7th grade, during the peak of my mortality panic, and it only added dirt onto the grave that was my mental health at that point (I'm still somewhat suffering the consequences now, just the issues currently are more personal). After dealing with all of the mortality stuff, I was still left with this. The Endless Chase of Life (ECL) will always be present at any age, as the chase is endless. My answer to this crisis is this: since I'm already in a state of despair, why can't I just be in despair while chasing goals of prolonging humanity? It's in a way like lying to yourself, I know that I'll never really have a positive impact on the world after all of the passsive and active ruining-of-the-planet-and-people-around-me I've done, but I can maybe logistically make the world a slightly more efficient place. I know this is a lie, and I know that I won't be fulfilled even if I do, but the arbitrary chase will in a sense make me somewhat happy while I do it. I'm reminded of Albert Camus (see the link posted underneath this post) and the entire philosophy of absurdism.

Anyway, I don't know how to end this post, so I'm just going to do it.
