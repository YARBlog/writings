**how does one get big-brain-ed**

I'm just going to assume that you, like I, enjoy feeling smart. It gives us a sense of superiority, and the ability to be recognized for your talents leads to many breaking their backs in the process of searching for it. It never ends, really. 2 math classes, AP chem and either AP computer science AB or engineering are the classes I've actually chosen to take next year, even after my counselors quite literally told me not to do it (AP chem is infamous at our school for being difficult), and yet I've still gone and done it. Why? Well, if you asked me that question in any other context that isn't YARB-related, I would say something along the lines of "I'd like to get into a more advanced STEM education and killing myself sophomore year seems to be the best way to do it. However, this is a YARB-related context, and I'll bet that you can probably guess why considering the things I just wrote, so I'll leave it up to you to find the trivial answer to that question. Regardless, after high school, my life will probably look like this: I go to a good or decent university and kill myself yet again getting a degree in mechanical or electrical or computer engineering. After this, I get a job at some company that probably doesn't exist now and kill myself working there. After 10 or so years of working, I die a single and friendelss man because I put no concern towards my physical or social health. All to just feel supieror to people who've taken easier and more fulfilling paths in life.

It is obvious here to say that none of this makes me intelligent. In fact, I don't think anything makes me intelligent because I'm not intelligent, I just like doing puzzles in part because they make me feel intelligent. However, I do think that intelligence, as intangible and fuzzy of a word it is, can be attained. This is because, according to me, the definition of intelligence is your ability to solve problems and process information quickly. Solving problems and processing information quickly is a skill that can be attained through a combination of heuristics and pattern-recognition. This does mean that intelligence as a function is directly proportional to work-ethic, but also discipline and slightly-so genetics and family's economic situation and passion for productive things. It is also nice to look at the big picture, and to realize that every human has, within a rounding error, the same level of intelligence, some are just more applied than others. Now, you might say this: "didn't you just contradict yourself by saying that you don't consider yourself intelligent and saying that all humans have roughly the same intelligence?" And you're right, partially (I could be saying that I think all humans are stupid, which I don't), which contributes to my contradictory view of intelligence.

All of this is to say: it is difficult to objectively measure intelligence because intelligence is useless if not applied. The explanation for the seemingly large difference in intelligence between people could be because some people are simply more applied than others in fields that we deem to be "for intelligent people."
