**average alternate experience**

Ahh, narcicism, one of the defining traits of every shitty person. This trait also happens to be within me, I think. Or is that just an excuse to make people think that I'm humble? Or even saying that could be an excuse for the exact same thing. This fractal downward spiral* has been quite the problem with my finite computing space and memory (only 2 lousy petabyes although i dont know the RAM of the brain). I've always been very self-absorbed which has ironically lead to me absolutely hating myself as a person, which also leads to a fractal downward spiral*. This has probably lead to me harming people in my personal life through my personal occupation. Now, of course, this is probably an over-reaction, but it is a geniune concern, and I've been attemting to communicate what effect I have on people (to little avail, but im still making progress) and how I can help in mitigating it. It always feels like I have a negative fun/mood effect on everybody I'm around, as I've noted many times that people seem much more disinterested when talking to me about something related to school or Math and Its Applications (MIA, an alternative to STEM that's more math heavy) than talking with other people about more boring subjects. This, in total, has lead to a large disconnect between me and the rest of humanity, with the exception of a small nerdy group of friends that I have.

**sorry this post is so jumpy, mind is racing atm**

There's the obvious: do I *want* to be in touch with humanity? Is this just another narcisistic endeavour that I'm doing just to grab attention? It's torture, really. I can't tell which thoughts of mine are authentic and which are creations of an egotistical, comnfort-seeking slob that lives inside of my head. All of this shit makes MIA so much more appealing to me.

**making [sin^2 + cos^2] more shitty connection before i log off cus i hafta study**

In math, a group is a set of objects with an operation between those objects that follows a specific set of axioms: all operations on that group are associative, they have an identity element, and they have an inverse. An example of this is the set of all integers with addition. For any 3 integers a,b,c, you can perform the + operation on them such that (a+c)+b = (a+b)+c = (b+c)+a. These elements also have an identity in the form of 0, and they have an inverse such that a + b = 0 (b in notation is written as -a). Note that this makes the set of natural numbers (starting with [sin^2 + cos^2], 2, 3...) not a group, as it does not consist of an inverse or an identity. The reason I've brought this up is that, given any set and an operation between them, it is possible to determine whether or not that set is group. Which is so much more damn simple than the mental calculus (ignore the fact that calculus is easier than group theory) required to determine whether or not a thought (a set of outputs from a neural network) is authentic or narcisitic.

**just map the brain not that hard**
**good job not answering the question btw although it was rhetorical**
