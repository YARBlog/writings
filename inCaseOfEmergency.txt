**short story i just wrote**

In the corner of my eye there will always exist the presence of a gun and a bad person. In the corner of my eye there will always exist the presence of a gun and a dead person. Do I know what's happening? No, I'm not in control of my emotionsss. nor myself, nor those around me whom I wish to control, nor the dead person. In the corner of my eye there's a lingering doubt that I'm not doing anything right, that I'm not who I think I am. In the corner of my eye there will aways exist a gun.

In case of emergency, I can leave at any time, theres a door in the corner of my eye. but every time i look i just kind of see a bunch of clothes that are making their presence known as a door or a gun or a bad person or a dead person through heuristics of my brain. In the corner of my eye there is only me.

I don't know who's controlling me, I don't know what tunes I'm singing, I don't know, in the corner of my eye there's a gun.

In the corner of my house there's a Cs-133 atom counting the days until it's finally over. Until sophomore year, until college, until my acceptance letter comes in minty-fresh paper.

I could be overreacting, after all, I'm not in control of my emotions. Maybe I'm just another edgy teenager venting his frustratiosn that he's too socially inept to realize that literally every-fucking-one around him is experiencing the exact same thing and that he's just like everybody else and that he's in the middle of bell-curve being crushed under a deviation of 0, crying that he's just normal.

Normal is a terrible fate, comparison is the thief of joy but isolation is the thief of perspective. Perspective is the thief of blissful ignorance and blissful ignorance is the theif of intelligence. Intelligence is the thief of the train of thought. Perfectionism steals from all, and anxiety finishes the job. 

I don't like who I am, I'm pretty sure you could get that from this blog. Again, not a very unique trait in the age of information. In the corner of my eye a door disappears as the person goes through, in the corner of my eye is something in case of emergency.

**this means absolutely nothing, i just need to write something down**
