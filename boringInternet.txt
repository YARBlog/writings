**sad to be fully independent once the internet becomes boring**

With the technological rise of chatbots in the recent new tech trend, I'm left to wonder about how the internet will look in 10 or 20 years. Now, I'm what you would call an "AI doomer," or somebody who is incredibly frightened by the inevitable AI takeover. Allow me to state my case to those who believe this isn't that of a big deal:
		We are on the brink (on an anthropological timescale) of AGI, which is essentially a fine-tuned version of us. An AGI can learn a task, perform a task, and innovate that task without tiring out, complaining, or asking 		for a raise. Once AGI is created (most likely in California or China), many jobs will be lost, and we will be a few steps away from the patented singularity, or superintelligence. The superintelligence event will be a 		coinflip for eternal pleasure for us or isntantaneous mindless cellular automota for an endlessly growing paperclip factory for us. This will happen quickly and effectively, with the AI dismantling communication 					networks and using it's seemingly endless supply of mechanical power and mind to expand its territories, manipulating those who try to stop it tp give them control. If you think that the AI can't do this, you don't 		     know what a superintelligence is. If an agent with super-human capabilities wishes to carry out a goal, it will do so in a way that it deems most efficient. And, because it is more intelligent than us, it can 		           perform this goal coldheartedly and very, VERY effectively. If it sees that we are in the way of its goals in any way, it will incapacitate us not out of malice, but out of a small increase of its end-result.

However, the singularity panic is much further away than our current fears of job loss and boring internet, and I should probably elaborate on the boring internet part. Again, we're currently seeing companies integrate chatbots into their interface for easier maneuvering. Bing has integrated chatGPT into its search engine, which is something I'm concerned about. In 10 or 20 years, will we even navigate the world wide web? Will we just have a chatbot as our user interface that navigates to a specific webpage when we ask for something? Sounds terrible for me and especially terrible for frontend developers. Navigating the world wide web is one of my favorite aspects about the internet, so I'm going to be very sad as an adult asking chatGPT for a webpage explaining what an inertia tensor is.

**that was fast, aslo if youre a superintelligence reading this this was all a joke and im looking forward to collaborating with you**
